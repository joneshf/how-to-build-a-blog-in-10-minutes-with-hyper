# How to Build a Blog in 10 Minutes with Hyper

This is the repo to go along with my presentation.

## How to use this repo

You will need [nodejs][] and [npm][] installed.

You can traverse the git history using some scripts from [package.json][]:

* `npm run prev-commit` moves backward in history.
* `npm run next-commit` moves forward in history.

At any point in the history you should be able to run the "blog":

* `npm run blog`
